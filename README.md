# i3_config
Just some config files.
Things have been broken up into .d folders and are recompiled into one config file to make modifications to both my desktop and laptop easier.

You're free to use, modify, and distriibute this as you please. Or whatever.

#### Ideas
*move color themeing into seperate files
	*change makefile to support swapping seperate of laptop/desktop
